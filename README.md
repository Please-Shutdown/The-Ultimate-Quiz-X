The Ultimate Quiz X is a remastered version of The Ultimate Quiz, that was recently shutdown due to bugs, and other big issues that the code had.
This Version is much cleaner, with better questions, and much much more stuff. Also, the quiz is not case sensitive.

To play the quiz, download it from the releases tab, right click once downloaded, go to open-with and choose Python. (You need to have Python on your computer in order to play it.

I am working on a really big project right now, so the quiz will get updated at least 1 time a week. Thank you.

Code template made by Bro Code, but I edited it a little bit too, so it matches with my preferences. Check out his channel below.
